2) Include a descriptive title that is straight to the point.

3) Write a detailed description on what the issue is all about.

### Code Contributions

Contributing code is one of the more difficult ways to contribute to Skeletonic.

**Feature Requests**

Filing feature requests is one of the most popular ways to contribute to Skeletonic.

Is there some feature request that you'd like to code up yourself? Is there a feature you asked for yourself that you'd like to code?

Here's how to contribute code for a new feature to Skeletonic. Pull Requests allow you to share your own code with us, and we can merge it into the main repo.

**Adding Code**

1) Fork the repo.

2) Clone the repo **you forked** by running
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/skeletonic.git
```

3) Install Node.js if you haven't already, and run `npm install`. This installs the required dependencies for building Skeletonic.

4) Edit files in the `src/` folder. For example, if you are fixing up forms, head to `src/forms.css` and add changes. Don't edit any files in the `dist/` folder, this is only for distribution builds, which are automated.

5) Run `npm run build` to run builds, and the new distribution files will be in the `dist/` folder ready to go.

**Fixing an Issue**
